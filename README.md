1. Participation motive
    In order to revitalize the traditional market, we are going to introduce a more modernized traditional market help system. Despite the fact that the current traditional market has a lot of delicious fruits compared to large-sized marts, it has not been able to effectively promote the information of the market to the customers of the market. I would like to develop a traditional market helper system that can solve these problems and make it possible to revitalize the traditional market which is losing market competitiveness.

2. Plan to prepare for participation
    Market factors that impede the activation of traditional markets. And then draw out ideas for solving the problems. Investigate through the internet site what technologies are needed to introduce the ideas actually brought into the traditional market. The hardware and software programming languages ​​are organized to actually implement the investigated technologies. Realize the designed software to actualize experiment and perfection.

3. Team members' role and collaboration plan
   Lim Hyun-jun is responsible for the hardware development area. Lim Soo-yeon is responsible for software development. In order to effectively share opinions and communicate smoothly, the development site, which is responsible for each of them, must be defective at the end. Through the recent popular github.com development hosting site, it is possible to share the progress of each development role in real time, We plan to increase the completeness of the works by collaborating.

4. Guidance goal and role of guidance teacher (mentor), guidance plan
   Make sure that team members are eager to participate in this task, and that they can lead in the right way. It instructs team members what additional content they need to make their ideas come true. The idea guides the technical issues that must be overcome in order to be actually available in traditional markets. It provides hints on how to tackle difficult issues as you implement them, and teaches techniques to refer to the answers of people who already have trouble through the Google site.


5. Development methodology for problem solving

   end. What part of the traditional (traditional) market do you want to improve?
      Traditionally, traditional markets are not able to promote customers who come to the market effectively, even if they have good food or discounted food. Some foods have a system that automatically and systematically notifies these events even if the traditional market is discounted at a much lower price than the large mart. To solve these problems, we intend to make a product that activates the so-called traditional market that manages and promotes traditional events or events using embedded devices automatically.
